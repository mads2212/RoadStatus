# RoadStatus

Instructions to run: 
- Just build the app and run the .exe file under bin\Debug\net6.0
- Don't forget to configure the API keys and appId on appsettings.json. There are two in the solution, one for the Console App (RoadStatus) and the other for the Tests (RoadStatus.Tests)
- The tests were created with NUnit. Use your favourite way of running them. I run them through my IDE (Jetbrains Rider).
